WaveRP is an Arduino library for recording and playing Wave files with the Adafruit Wave Shield. It records 8-bit mono files at 4,000 to 44,100 samples per second.

Use of the Wave record/play library, WaveRP, requires the following:

Arduino with a 5 volt 328 processor.

Low noise power source such as a nine volt DC adapter or battery.
